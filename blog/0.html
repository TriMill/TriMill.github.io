      For a long time, 0 was not considered a number. After all, how can the lack of anything be a thing in and of itself? Positional systems (like decimal and binary) need a 0 symbol, otherwise, for example, the numbers 203 and 23 would be written the same. Many systems started out by using a space, but this still leaves room for confusion.

    <p>
      The symbol used for 0 likely originated in India along with the base-10 system used in most of the world. Positional systems are much more efficient for calculations than other systems used at the time, like Roman numerals. As such, Arabic numerals were adopted quite quickly. For a while after, though, 0 was considered just a placeholder symbol and not an actual number.

      When people discuss weird numbers, they often talk about irrationals (π, e, ϕ), <a href="https://youtu.be/23I5GS4JiDg">infinities</a> (ℵ<sub>0</sub>, ω), quaternions and octonions, etc. They often miss perhaps the strangest number of all, <i>0</i>. Every single real number, every complex, every quaternion and octonion, every ordinal and cardinal, even every surreal number has a reciprocal. 0 does not. Many people erroneously believe the reciprocal of 0 is "infinity", which if true would likely also make <math>2/0</math> "infinity". If <math><a href="1.html">1</a>/0 = 2/0</math>, multiplying both sides by 0 gives <math>1 = 2</math>, which is clearly false.

    <h2>Information</h2>
    <div class="information">
      0 is the first natural number (integers greater than or equal to 0). <br />
      It is the additive identity, so adding 0 to a number does not change it: <math><i>a</i> + 0 = <i>a</i></math><br />
      Multiplying anything by 0 yields 0: <math><i>a</i> &middot; 0 = 0</math>, and as a result, division by 0 is impossible (no number times 0 will give the numerator). <br />
      Any non-0 number raised to the 0<sub>th</sub> power is 1: <math><i>a</i><sup>0</sup> = 1</math>. 0 to the power of 0 is undefined. <br />
      0 is neither prime (since any number times 0 is 0, it has all numbers for factors) nor composite (since it cannot be written as a product of primes without using 0). Since it is divisible by all numbers except itself, it is even. <br />
      0 is the 0<sub>th</sub> term of the Fibbonacci sequence.<br />
      0 is written "0" in all natural number bases.

    <div class="edit">Edit 2019-2-6: Added information about different number bases, added equations to "Information" section, corrected usage of the word "zero" to the number, added more cardinal names. Separated prime factors and divisors. Added powers and roots.
