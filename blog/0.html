      For a long time, zero was not considered a number. After all, how can the lack of anything be a thing in and of itself? Positional systems (like decimal and binary) need a zero symbol, otherwise, for example, the numbers 203 and 23 would be written the same. Many systems started out by using a space, but this still leaves room for confusion.

      The symbol used for zero likely originated in India along with the base-10 system used in most of the world. Positional systems are much more efficient for calculations than other systems used at the time, like Roman numerals. As such, Arabic numerals were adopted quite quickly. For a while after, though, zero was considered just a placeholder symbol and not an actual number.

      When people discuss weird numbers, they often talk about irrationals (π, e, ϕ), <a href="https://youtu.be/23I5GS4JiDg">infinities</a> (ℵ<sub>0</sub>, ω), quaternions and octonions, etc. They often miss perhaps the strangest number of all, <i>Zero</i>. Every single real number, every complex, every quaternion and octonion, every ordinal and cardinal, even every surreal number has a reciprocal. Zero does not. Many people erroneously believe the reciprocal of zero is "infinity", which if true would likely also make <math>2/0</math> "infinity". If <math>1/0 = 2/0</math>, multiplying both sides by zero gives <math>1 = 2</math>, which is clearly false.

    <h2>Information</h2>
    <div class="information">
      Zero is the first natural number (integers greater than or equal to zero). <br />
      It is the additive identity, so adding zero to a number does not change it. <br />
      Multiplying anything by zero yields zero, and as a result, division by zero is impossible (no number times zero will give the numerator). <br />
      Any non-zero number raised to the zeroth power is 1. Zero to the power of zero is undefined. <br />
      Zero is neither prime (since any number times zero is zero, it has all numbers for factors) nor composite (since it cannot be written as a product of primes without using 0). Since it is divisible by all numbers except itself, it is even. <br />
      Zero is the zeroth term of the Fibbonacci sequence.
