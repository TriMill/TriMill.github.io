      Yesterday, I said that <a href="0.html">0</a> was the first natural number, which is partially a lie. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_80000-2">ISO 80000-2</a>, the natural numbers include all non-negative integers, starting from 0 and increasing by 1 each time. Some people disagree with this definition, saying instead that the natural numbers start at 1 and exclude 0, and the <i>whole</i> numbers are the natural numbers along with 0. This only leads to more confusion, as in some texts whole numbers include all integers, positive, negative, and 0. I will be including 0 in my definition of natural numbers. If you do not agree, disregard the previous page and pretend I stared here.

      Many people are suprised when they learn that 1 is not a prime number. After all, the typical definition that children learn is "a number with only 1 and itself for factors", which is a definition that would allow for 1 to be prime. This definition is quickly revised to require the number to have <i>exactly</i> two factors. After this most just accept this as fact without really considering why.

      The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is (as you can tell by the name) a very important theorem in algebra. It states that any natural number greater than 1 is either itself a prime number or can be written <b>uniquely</b> as a product of primes. A number's prime factorization is unique to that number and that number only. If 1 were considered a prime number you could write, for example 6 as <math>2 &middot; 3</math>, <math>1 &middot; 2 &middot; 3</math>, <math>1 &middot; 1 &middot; 2 &middot; 3</math>, and so on. The <i>real</i> reason 1 is not considered prime is because it would make this very important theorem (and as it turns out, many other statements based on prime factorization), be false unless they specified "all primes except 1". 1 behaves like a non-prime much more often than it does like a prime.

    <h2>Information</h2>
    <div class="information">
      1 is the multiplicative identity, anything multiplied by 1 is itself: <math><i>a</i> &middot; 1 = <i>a</i></math>.<br />
      1 raised to any power is 1: <math>1<sup>a</sup> = 1</math>. Any number raized to the power 1 is itself: <math>a<sup>1</sup> = a</math>.<br />
      The symbol for the digit "1" usually has 1 vertical stroke, evidence of earlier tally counting systems.<br />
      1 is the first positive odd number.<br />
      Tallying is often called "base 1" because each tally mark represents the same amount<br />
      1 is both the first and second element in the Fibonacci sequence. The next element is 2.<br />
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's law</a> says that the first (highest-valued) digit in real-world data will be 1 around 30% of the time (it would be 11.1% in an equal distribution). 2 occurs around 17.6% of the time and 3 occurs around 12.5% of the time, meaning that over half of real-world numbers begin with 1, 2, or 3.
